I want to introduce you to somebody who loves CSS grid probably more than anyone, and that is Piet Mondrian. 
He is a Dutch painter who has created masterpieces that you might have seen before.
And they look like this one, Composition No. III with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black, which is nota very creative name, but it is a beautiful painting, especially if you're really into grids, whichhe is.
But also it seems like a lot of other people are, because this piece was auctioned off for a whopping $50.6 million.
This project uses concepts like HTML, CSS Grid, Flex to have the same painting on the web.
